# Financial Data Science & Machine Learning 📈
### Applied Studies from "OutSpoken Market na Prática"

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in the **OutSpoken Market** course. Here, I apply core concepts of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Linear Algebra to financial markets using Python.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to automate financial analysis and build predictive models. Instead of using static files, I leverage real-time data to create dynamic technical indicators and trading signals.

### Key Knowledge Areas:
* **Python for Finance:** Data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy.
* **Data Acquisition:** Automated fetching from **TradingView API** using `tvDatafeed`.
* **Linear Algebra & Statistics:** Implementation of Moving Averages and cumulative sums for trend identification.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating professional financial charts with Matplotlib, featuring conditional formatting for trend analysis.
